PROJECT BRIEF:

So first things first, our web application is actually called Recipes! (But brandon made a typo when typing out the project name.)

So our idea for Recipes was a place where people could post food recipes made by themself and see food recipes made by others too! Following this main idea, we also made it so that we could implement as much interaction as possible to make the website feel more likely for users. We explored and found ways to make finding food recipes become more diverse, from recipes which only take 5-10 mintues, to Chinese cuisines, Itlian cuisines, to recipes which have been highly favourited by the community, to recipes where people can specially search for via its name and more! Lastly, we added a gamification concept on top of this whole system, creating ways to reward those who interacted with other posts, and even more to those whom posted and had good reviews on their posts. We came up with our own brand currency, Reci-points, and a design for it as well displayed on the top right side of the website. With reci-points, users can slowly accumulate and eventually purchase food vouchers and even merchandies which we designed as well. Overall, we wanted to make this web application not only diverse, but user-friendly as well as with the introduction ofx so many concepts, its easily understandalbe to be confused. Hence we have tried our best to layout all the features and buttons in a way where almost anyone could understand and not get lost in the web applicaiton.

PROJECT DESIGN'S PROCESS:

When we came up with the main gist of our website, the barebones of finding and posting food recipes, parents were already our main target audience. As such, we firstly took into consideration of designing a website which didn't have a kiddish design. Then, we thought about what parents would generally search for in a dish prepartion. Is it how long it takes to cook the dish? Is it healthy? Is it intersting? Can I find Vietnamese dishes on the website? The list of thoghts go on and so fourth. So, with so many thoughts from parents to consider, we made searching dishes on our website as wide of a variety as possible. Our homepage have 4 main category of dishes, highly favoruite ones, made in 5-10mins, fusion ones and lastly dishes which have just been recently posted. In the search page, users can also search the name of the dish in the search bar, or also choose to click one of the suggested cuisines below. If I was a parent looking for a dish, would I be in a hurry to make one? If so, I would head to the 5-10mins section. Like mentioned earlier, parents may be in so many different situations when finding a dish, so we hoped we provided as much search options as possible.
